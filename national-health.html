The current state of healthcare in America can best be described as this: Whenever you go grocery shopping, a man stops you from entering the checkout line. He demands that you pay him and then he will negotiate the price of all the shoppers' groceries. 
Such a system appears to be completely absurd, and that is because it is completely absurd. Healthcare must go through a radical paradigm shift so that individuals may directly and immediately, in the terms of this analogy, "go through the checkout line."
<br/><br/>
Healthcare is unlike most other commodities on the market, as it is n inelastic good: it does not respond to changes in economic variables. The economic reason is that its demand is near constant. Vast increases in its price will not correlate to vast decreases in its demand. Rather, the demand will only fall off a tiny percentage.
The underlying cause is that people always need health care, more so than any other good excluding food and water. Consider a person that is in a car crash: he will be rushed to the nearest hospital. The same is true of anyone in a dire medical emergency. There is no time nor ability to examine the costs of different hospitals.
Personal choice, as Adam Smith wrote, is the "invisible hand" that guides the market towards the best case for everyone involved. There is no choice in healthcare, choice is fundamentally removed. Considering this and that healthcare is essential to a person's life, I venture to say that healthcare should not be a market commodity at all.
Our continued acceptance of it as one is morally bankrupt and economically unwise.
<br/><br/>
The cost of healthcare has grown so exorbitant in America that people are more and more avoiding getting treatment for their problems for fear that it will cause their financial bankruptcy. Health problems compound very easily, and what may start as a minor pain can, in the best case, involuntarily hospitalize a person, which the cost thereof at this point will surely force them into bankruptcy. And of course there is the ever-stronger possibility of death the longer treatment is avoided. Any system which results in the death of even one person because of financial burden is entirely morally indefensible. 
<br/><br/>
The study of economics is not number theory. It is not reducing costs into some pre-defined concept of efficiency. It is a social science that studies how one’s environment and conditions influences their behavior, particularly monetarily. Therefore the goal of economic policy is to make the great number of people better-off without making anyone worse-off. The current healthcare system certainly only makes a select few better-off, while leaving the majority of Americans worse-off.
<br/><br/>
The Affordable Care Act only supplemented this existing system with (1) government-sponsored insurance, (2) the individual mandate, and (3) insurance regulations. Government-sponsored insurance, while it only applies to people within 400% of the federal poverty line, is an excellent first step however it only perpetuates the existing system with government money, which still leaves most Americans with insurmountable medical debt. The individual mandate, which required everyone to either buy insurance or have it through their employers, with a waiver for low-income earners, was designed to lower insurance costs as not only at risk people would have insurance, meaning insurance companies to have more revenue with less persons they actually need to pay out for, which would in theory allow them to lower costs. The main insurance regulation was that insurance companies could no longer deny people based on pre-existing conditions, allowing more people to have health insurance.
<br/><br/>
The reason the ACA was designed as a supplemental to the American healthcare system, rather than “repeal and replace” it is twofold. One, the health insurance industry is one of the largest contributors to both Democratic and Republican political campaigns, and they have no desire to see that money disappear. Two, the ACA is based on “RomneyCare,” which was implemented by Governor Mitt Romney in Massachusetts. “RomneyCare” is based on a proposal for a national healthcare system published by the Heritage Foundation, a Republican think-tank. The ACA is, at its core, a Republican idea. It was supposed to have bipartisan support, as a touchstone for the Congressional Progressive Caucus which wants to eventually implement single-player free healthcare, and the Republicans as it is their proposal. However, the Republicans turned on their own idea as their new platform of obstructionism, and the ACA passed Congress without a single Republican vote.
<br/><br/>
The shortcomings of the ACA are major and widespread: in several states, premiums have increased, small employers have been forced to swap full-time employees for part-time labor (under a new regulation that if a company has over 50 full-time employees it must provide health insurance for all employees),many large corporations have opted for part-time labor as a method to cut costs, and the law fails to significantly fix the underlying disease that is the American healthcare system. The only thing of substance it has accomplished is getting more Americans than ever before insured, and that is only because of the individual mandate. 
<br/><br/>
The government, on the state or federal level, must nationalize the healthcare system: it must invest in hospitals, run them directly, to be itself responsible for the health and well-being of its citizens; to eliminate the corrupt and morally reprehensible health insurance industry. The government has the supreme responsibility to secure the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Until it secures the right of healthcare -- and healthcare is a right -- it fails on this basic promise.
<br/><br/>
A federally ran healthcare program is constitutional, provided that it meets the requirements of “basic” -- it provides the same minimum level of care across the nation -- and “universal” -- it applies to all people in the United States equally, regardless of citizenship or immigration status, income level, or payment of taxes or amount paid in taxes. This is the absolute minimum that must be implemented: an affordable universal basic health care program in the United States. Private hospitals of course may continue to exist.
<br/><br/>
The Constitution was framed as a living document, based on the natural rights of humans. It does not create, bestow, or provide rights, it safeguards the rights of humans granted by their personhood. Nor are the rights enumerated exhaustive: there are other rights. Life is a natural right, health care protects and safeguards life: an argument can be paid that healthcare is a natural right. That is an entirely different debate, but if this premise is found to be true, then healthcare is a right protected by the Constitution.
<br/><br/>
The proposal made here is for a free universal basic health care program ran by the federal government. The income tax would be used to finance this system (considering that no tax money may be spent on abortions). However, there would be no need for an increase in the income tax for two reasons:
Currently, employers with over 50 full-time employees must sponsor a health care insurance program and pay for it for all of their employees. This s regressive, as it encourages employers to rely mostly on part-time labor, as health insurance is expensive. With the government providing health care, this burden is lifted from employers, enabling them to hire more employees and pay them higher wages. This results in more money being paid in taxes.
The United States, between Medicare, Medicaid, and the VA, already spends more money on healthcare than any other country in the world. If all this spending was consilidated into one health care program, it would require less money and produce results for all Americans.
With these two reasons, there is little foundation to believe that an extensive health care program would require any additional spending or tax increase.
<br/><br/>
Most other countries, developed or developing, have an universal basic health care program. The United Kingdom are the closest countries to the United Staets, politically and socially, in terms of similarity. Both have such a program: Medicare in Austrialia and the National Health Service in the United Kingdom. Russia has the Federal Complusory Medical Insurance Fund, China has Healthy China 2020. Of the United Nations Security Council, the United States stands alone as the only country without a government health care program. In the modern world, free universal basic healthcare is a right and necessity implemented by almost all the world except the United States.
<br/><br/>
As it stands now, the government does not fund health care. Rather, it subsidies insurance companies who then subsidies underpaid workers, an order in the tens of billions of dollars. This costs substantially more than the cost of directly funding health care. Such a system s largely ineffective, and in the long-term unsubstainable, and it must be abolished immeditally.
